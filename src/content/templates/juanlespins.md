Juan-les-pins is a small shore on the north bit of the Mediterrannean sea. 

It’s 1964, Ella Fitzgerald is singin’ with her band at the Jazz à Juan festival, where she just can’t finish her song because the hot weather was turning the cicada in the *pinède* completely off.

So she waits a bit, and at some point, she starts to sing a song with the music of the night. History will remember it as the crickets song, but french folks know better, it should have been called the Cicada tune :)
